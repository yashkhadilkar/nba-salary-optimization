A comprehensive data science project demonstrating contract efficiency optimization for NBA teams using machine learning, web scraping, and interactive visualizations.

## Problem Statement

NBA teams operate under strict salary cap constraints and struggle with:
- Market Inefficiencies: $1.433B in overpaid contracts league-wide
- Resource Allocation: Limited budget requiring optimal player selection
- Decision Complexity: Trade, draft, and free agency choices with unclear ROI
- Performance Gaps: Disconnect between player salaries and actual value delivered

## Solution

Built an end-to-end data science pipeline that analyzes 3,360+ player-seasons to identify market inefficiencies and generate actionable insights for NBA front offices:
- Advanced Analytics: 4 machine learning models for salary prediction and value estimation
- Optimization Algorithms: Roster construction strategies within salary cap constraints
- Interactive Dashboard: 26 visualizations providing executive-ready insights
- Trade Engine: ROI-based recommendations for player transactions

## Impact

- $1.433B in market overpay identified across 489 players analyzed
- 21.07% ROI opportunity through strategic contract optimization
- $0.86B in potential savings achievable through data-driven roster management
- 69.1% market health score with 338 value players vs 151 overpaid contracts
